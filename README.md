## Standards ##
* [Cranium][525] - Portable, header-only ANN library in C99. [``MIT``][MIT]

## AI ##

Computer vision, neural nets, machine learning, and other similar things.
Basically, if your university calls it AI, it lives here.

* [ccv][195] - C-based/Cached/Core Computer Vision library; modern computer
  vision. [``BSD-3-Clause``][BSD-3-Clause]

## Build Systems ##

Tools that automate the building and testing of projects in C.


## Compilers ##

Compilers, as well as compiler- and compilation-related tooling.


## Compression ##

## Concurrency and Parallelism ##



## Crypto ##

Mostly library implementations of well-known cryptographic algorithms or
protocols.



## Database ##

Databases and data stores with Go APIs.

## Data Structures ##

## Debugging ##

Because we all have to do it sometimes. Various tools for making debugging
easier or better, as well as libraries or code that allows better debugging
work.

## Documentation Generation ##

## Editors ##

Fancier, IDE-type editors. If you want a programmer's text editor, look
elsewhere. Besides, whatever you use most likely supports C anyway.

## Frameworks ##

Big libraries that provide data structures and other stuff you expect of a
'modern' standard library.

## Game Programming ##

Engines, libraries and other helpful things specifically for making games.

## Graphics ##

Programmatic manipulation of graphics in C; if you want to make a GUI, the
Graphical User Interface section has what you need.

## Graphical User Interface ##

Widget toolkits, or things meant to be used in a similar way to them.

## Hashing ##

Hash function implementations for *non*-crypto purposes. Cryptographic hashes
can be found in the Crypto section.

## JSON ##

## Learning, Reference and Tutorials ##

Resources for learning C programming in general, or something useful relating
to C programming.

### Reference resources online ###

### Beginner resources online ###

* [A tutorial on pointers][213]

### Intermediate resources online ###

* [8 gdb tricks you should know][206]


### Advanced resources online ###

* [Advanced metaprogramming in C][357]

### Online self-study courses ###


### Reference books ###


### Beginner books ###


### Intermediate books ###

### Advanced books ###

## Lexing and Parsing ##

Libraries specifically for lexical analysis (or lexing) and syntactic analysis
(or parsing).

## Memory Management ##

Whether a different, faster malloc or outright garbage collection, anything
to do with managing C memory lives here.

## Multimedia ##

## Networking and Internet ##

Low-level networking and internet-related stuff. If you want something more
comprehensive and high-level, you may want the Web Frameworks section.

## Numerical ##

## Profiling ##

## Regex ##

## Serialization ##

## Source Code Collections ##

Collections of small source code. If you want something big and integrated, check
the Frameworks section.

## Standard Libraries ##

Implementations of the (standard-mandated) C standard library.

## String Manipulation ##

## Testing ##

## Text Editor Extensions ##

While practically any decent programmer's text editor supports C, there are some
extensions that make it more pleasant. These are labelled by editor.

## Tools ##

Useful programs to help you write and debug C code which are *not* editors,
libraries or compilers.

## Utilities ##

A 'catch-all' category for anything that doesn't fit well anywhere else.

## Web Frameworks ##

Comprehensive and integrated solutions for building the next brilliant web
application in C.

* [facil.io][118] - Mini-framework for web applications. Includes a fast HTTP and
  Websocket server, and also supports custom protocols. [``MIT``][MIT]
* [KLone][423] - Fully-featured, multi-platform, web application development
  framework, targeted especially at embedded systems and
  appliances. [``BSD-3-Clause``][BSD-3-Clause]
* [Kore][415] - Easy-to-use web application framework for writing scalable
  web APIs in C. [``ISC``][ISC]

## Windows Environments ##

Technologies designed to bring Windows into the 21st century with respect to
support for C.

## XML ##

* [Expat][89] - Stream-oriented XML parser. [MIT][MIT]
